A responsive off canvas menu using jQuery and css animations
===============

This menu uses jQuery to trigger the menu classes, add the hamburger and opened menu 'close'. The CSS handles all the animation and content for the closer when the menu is open. So very little JS editing needed to set it up.
<br/><br/>I wrote this for a specific purpose that needed a logo, hence the logo!.<br/>At some point I will add dropdown sub menus and touch swipe functionality but for now this is what I need.
